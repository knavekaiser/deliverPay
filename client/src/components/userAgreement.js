            on certain projects. You will be notified and asked to confirm on
            award/accept of such projects the appropriate GST treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Indian Seller on Delivery Pay only: As of 1st of October 2018
            Indian GST laws mandate a collection of 1% GST by DeliveryPay.in as
            tax on the net value of taxable supplies made by the Seller through
            the web portal of Delivery Pay. Accordingly, Delivery Pay shall
            collect a 1% tax from the net value of the taxable projects or
            listings made by the Buyer and will deposit the same to the Indian
            government exchequer in accordance with applicable GST laws. In
            cases where (i) the Seller is outside India and (ii) GST is payable
            by the Buyer under reverse charge basis, Delivery Pay is not
            required to collect this tax.

          <h3>18. Limits & Fraud Prevention</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to suspend a User withdrawal request if the
            source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we become aware that any funds received into an Account from
            another Account as a result of a fraudulent transaction, this will
            be reversed immediately. If those funds have already been released
            to you, you must pay the funds into your Account. If you do not do
            so, we may suspend, limit or cancel your account, or take action
            against you to recover those funds.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all of the
            funds in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the funds) if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              we believe there may be an unacceptable level of risk associated
              with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions,
              including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will
              be subject to reversal or chargeback;
            </li>
            <li>
              we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other
              than you;
            </li>
            <li>
              we believe that the payment is being made to a country where we do
              not offer our Service; or
            </li>
            <li>
              we are required to do so by law or applicable law enforcement
              agencies.

          <p>
            If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain circumstances)
            place a temporary limit on the funds in your Account to cover the
            amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in
            your favour, we will lift the limit on your funds and those funds
            may be released to you. If the dispute is not resolved in your
            favour, we may remove the funds from your Account. We may also place
            a limit on your account in circumstances where we suspect you of
            fraudulent or other unacceptable behaviour, while we investigate any
            such matter.

          <h3>19. Refunds</h3>
          <p>
            You may ask for a refund at any time for any funds that you have
            paid into your Account except if the amount to refund relates to a
            Payment Intervals subject to Section 25 or relates to fees or
            charges payable to us. If the amount the User has asked to refund
            relates to:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              a Payment Intervals subject to Section 25, the Dispute Resolution
              Process may be followed; or
            </li>
            <li>
              our fees and charges, the process set out in the Clause "Disputes
              with Us" must be followed.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User has
            requested funds be refunded if:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to
              do so;
            </li>
            <li>
              we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any
              dispute or an increase in our costs;
            </li>
            <li>
              we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund policy
              specified by us from time to time;
            </li>
            <li>
              we find out that the original payment made by the User is
              fraudulent;
            </li>
            <li>the User made a duplicate payment in error; or</li>
            <li>
              we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the
              refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You can request a refund by using our customer support website or

            dispute resolution process in this agreement, expressly agree to be
            bound by its ruling and expressly agree not to initiate any
            chargeback request with your card issuer.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you initiate any chargeback request or other "Request for

          </p>
          <p>
            If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User

            original payment to us.

            their card issuer or financial institution), and any subsequent
            reversal instruction, is made by the payment product issuer or third
            parties (such as payment processors) and not by us. We are bound to
            follow such instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover any

            product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on
            funds paid to you by Buyers through the Website, as well as any
            processing or any other fees whatsoever incurred by us on those

          <h3>25. Requirements for Californian Users and Payment Intervalss</h3>
          <p>
            In the state of California, United States of America, Payment
            Intervalss are regarded as regulated escrow activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Section deals with and applies to Payment Intervalss that are
            connected to California, i.e. where a User, being a Buyer or a
            Seller, is ordinarily resident in California, United States of
            America (“California User” or “California Users”).
          </p>
          <p>
            So that we can continue to serve our California Users, Escrow.com (a
            business owned and separately operated by Delivery Pay) will
            facilitate escrow transactions on behalf of a Buyer and/or Seller
            either of whom is a California User, and to hold the funds in
            relation to any Project. Until further notice, there will be no
            additional Fees for facilitating an escrow transaction initiated as
            a result of this Section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where a California User is a Buyer or Seller in relation to any
            Project, and a Buyer seeks to initiate a Payment Intervals, the
            Users will be directed to complete Payment Intervalss through
            Escrow.com as a Transaction (‘California Transaction”) in accordance
            with the Escrow.com Terms of Use and General Escrow Instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Escrow.com Group includes Escrow.com Inc. and Internet Escrow
            Services, Inc (“IES”) which are owned and operated by a wholly owned
            subsidiary in the Delivery Pay Group. IES is a licensed Escrow Agent
            in the state of California holding Escrow Agent License No. 9631867,
            issued by the California Department of Business Oversight. As part
            of using the Escrow.com service you authorise Delivery Pay to share
            your information with the Escrow.com Group to complete Escrow.com’s
            identity verification and know your customer procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            On completion of the work related to the Payment Intervals, the
            Seller will direct IES to disburse the proceeds of the Escrow.com
            Transaction to the User’s Account with Delivery Pay.
          </p>
          <p>Accepted Currencies for Payment Intervalss and California Users</p>
          <p>
            Escrow.com currently supports Transactions in three currencies; U.S.
            Dollars, Euros and Indian Dollars (“Supported Currencies”). If a
            Buyer's Payment Method is denominated in a currency other than the
            supported currencies, a currency conversion will be required for the
            Payment Intervals to be made and an Escrow.com Transaction to
            proceed. We will display foreign currency conversion rates that
            Delivery Pay, Escrow, or our Affiliates currently make available to
            convert supported foreign currencies to one of the Supported
            Currencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            These foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on
            market conditions. Wholesale currency conversion rates at which
            Delivery Pay or our Affiliates obtain foreign currency will usually
            be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on
            the Site. Each User, in its sole discretion and risk, may authorize
            the charge, debit, or credit of its Payment Method in a supported
            foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to one of the
            supported currencies at the foreign currency conversion rate
            displayed on the Site. A list of supported foreign currencies is
            available on the Site. If foreign currency conversion is required to
            make a payment in one of the Supported Currencies and either
            Delivery Pay, Escrow, or our Affiliates does not support the foreign
            currency or the User does not authorize the conversion of such
            payment at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the
            Site, Escrow or one of our Affiliates will charge, debit, or credit
            the User's Payment Method and the User's Payment Method provider
            will convert the payment at a foreign currency conversion rate
            selected by the User's Payment Method provider. The User's Payment
            Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method
            even when no currency conversion is involved. The User's
            authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate
            displayed on the Site is at the User's sole risk. Delivery Pay,
            Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency
            fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method
            denominated in a currency other than one of the Supported
            Currencies. Delivery Pay, Escrow, and our Affiliates are not
            responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or
            sending payments to and from the Escrow Account.

          <p>
            Release and Delivery of Amounts in Escrow Buyers and Sellers in a
            California Transaction irrevocably authorize and instruct IES to
            release applicable portions of the Payment Intervals in an Escrow
            Account (each portion, a “Release”) to their Seller Escrow Account
            or in the event of a refund, the Buyer Escrow Account, as
            applicable, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or
            more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by
            applicable law or the Terms of Service. The amount of any Release
            will be delivered to the applicable Delivery Pay Account in
            accordance with Seller’s or Buyer’s authorization, as above, these
            Instructions, and the IES Terms of Service and General Escrow
            Instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As used in these Instructions, “Release Condition” means any of the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Buyer clicks to release funds to Seller.</li>
            <li>
              Buyer does not take any action for 14 days from the date of a
              Seller’s Release request, in which case Seller and Buyer agree
              that IES is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately
              release to Seller the amount associated in the applicable
              milestone in connection with such Release request.
            </li>
            <li>
              Seller cancels the contract before a Payment Intervals has been

            </li>
            <li>
              Buyer and Seller have submitted joint written instructions for a

              as applicable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Buyer and Seller agree to close the contract without release of
              funds, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Buyer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Buyer or Seller has failed to make its Arbitration payment or paid
              its fair share of the Arbitration costs pursuant to the Dispute
              Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the
              Party that has made its Arbitration Payment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Both Buyer and Seller have failed to timely submit to Arbitration
              for an unresolved Dispute as such term is defined in the Dispute
              Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the
              Buyer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Buyer or Seller has failed timely to respond to a Delivery Pay
              Dispute Resolution Service notification as required by the Dispute

            </li>
            <li>
              Buyer or Seller otherwise has failed to comply with the Dispute
              Resolution Service, in which case the funds are to be released to
              the User that has complied with the Dispute Resolution Service.
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
              Issuance of the final order of a court of competent jurisdiction
