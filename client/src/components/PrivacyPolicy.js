          <p>
            We collect personal information about our users in order provide our
            products, services, and customer support. Our products, services,
            and customer support are provided through many platforms including
            but not limited to: websites, phone apps, email, and telephone. The
            specific platform and product, service, or support you interact with
            may affect the personal data we collect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all information requested, collected, and processed by us is
            "Personal Information" as it does not identify you as a specific
            natural person. This will include majority of "User Generated
            Content" that you provide us with the intention of sharing with
            other users. Such "Non-Personal Information" is not covered by this
            privacy policy. However, as non-personal information may be used in
            aggregate or be linked with existing personal information; when in
            this form it will be treated as personal information. As such, this
            privacy policy will list both types of information for the sake of
            transparency.

            without us asking for it, or through means not intended for the
            collection of particular types of information. Whilst we may take
            reasonable steps to protect this data, the user will have bypassed
            our systems, processes, and control and thus the information
            provided will not be governed by this privacy policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some situations users may provide us personal information over
            platforms that are outside our control; for example through social
            media or forums. Whilst any information collected by us is governed
            by this Privacy Policy, the platform by which it was communicated
            will be governed by its own Privacy Policy.

            We use automated decision when helping matching users to jobs. The
            primary way this occurs is through how we rank users. These rankings
            are produced by analysing user generated content, user activity and
            the outcome of jobs; in this context, user generated content will
            include reviews that users receive when completing jobs. More
            information on these ranking guides can be found in our community
            articles. Automated decision making is also used to recommend
            potential jobs to our users and as a part of our marketplace
            security systems.

          <h3>Exercising your other rights</h3>
          <p>
            You have a number of other rights in relation to the personal data
            DeliverPay holds about you, however, there may be restrictions on
            how you may exercise the rights. This is largely due to the nature
            of the products and services we provide. Much of the data we collect
            is in order to facilitate contracts between users, facilitate
            payments, and provide protection for the legitimate users of our
            marketplace - these data uses are protected against the below
            rights.
          </p>
          <p>You have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>seek human review of automated decision-making or profiling</li>
            <li>opt-out of direct marketing, and profiling for marketing</li>
            <li>erasure</li>
            <li>temporary restriction of processing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Human review of automated decision making / profiling - In the case
            of our ranking algorithms, it is not possible to exercise this right
            as this ranking is a fundamental part of the marketplace that users
            participate in, opting out would mean not being able to participate
            in the marketplace. Decisions affecting marketplace security are
            already reviewed by humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Direct marketing and profiling - users can control what emails they
            receive through their settings page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Erasure - Most personal information and user generated content
            cannot be deleted as they are used to support contracts between
            users, document financial transactions, and are used in providing
            protecting other legitimate users of the marketplace. In the case of
            non-personal data that can be linked with personal data, it will
            either be erased or otherwise anonymised from the personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Temporary restriction to processing - under certain circumstances
            you may exercise this right, in particular if you believe that the
            personal data we have is not accurate, or you believe that we do not
            have legitimate grounds for processing your information. In either
